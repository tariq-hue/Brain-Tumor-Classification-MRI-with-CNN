# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Classification using CNN (TensorFlow)

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using **TensorFlow** to classify brain MRI scans and detect tumors.  
The goal is to build a deep learning pipeline that assists in medical image analysis and improve training and validation results .
